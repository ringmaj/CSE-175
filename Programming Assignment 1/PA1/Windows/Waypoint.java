//
// Waypoint
//
// This class implements a "node" in a search tree being constructed to find
// a shortest path from one location to another on a map.  Each node includes
// a reference to the corresponding location "state", a reference to its parent
// in the search tree (i.e., the "previous" node), and a collection of children
// nodes (i.e., the "options" for the next step) which remains empty until the
// node is expanded.  Each Waypoint node also records the depth of the node in
// the search tree, the partial path cost from the initial node in the search
// tree to this one, and a heuristic evaluation value for this node.  This
// class provides two noteworthy methods.  First, the "expand" method fills 
// in the "options" list of children of this node, using information embedded
// in this node's Location object.  Second, the "reportSolution" recursive 
// method uses the "previous" references of nodes in the search tree in order
// to output the path from the initial node of the search tree to this node.
